# Flexbox Froggy

**I solved Flexbox Froggy! 🥳**

I'm so excited to share that I finally solved Flexbox Froggy! This game is a great way to learn about Flexbox, and it was a lot of fun to play. 🐸

The platforms in the game are styled using Flexbox, so I had to use Flexbox concepts to solve the levels. I started by learning about the different Flexbox properties, and then I used those properties to style the platforms in different ways. 💡

As I progressed through the levels, the challenges got harder, but I was able to use my Flexbox skills to solve them all. I'm really proud of myself for solving the game, and I'm excited to keep learning about Flexbox. 💪
